I prefer the full comp better because it allows me to get a better idea of what the site will look like without writing all of the html and css code out. With that being said though the style tiles are extremly usefull for figuring out what you want to use in a quicker fashion than the full comp, but they work well together. I spent a few hours doing each of the style tiles and the full comp.
