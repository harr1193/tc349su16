    <h1>Principles of Design Assignment</h1>
  </header>
  
  <h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>

  <p>This is a screenshot of apples website which I chose to represent
  the signal-to-noise ratio design principle because it is kept very simple
  and not much thinking is needed to get to where you need to go. The buttons
  at the top of the page make it clear where to click for what you are looking for
  and the design of the site is kept simple from a color and layout perspective.</p>
  
  <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

  <p>This is a screenshot of a coffee brewing company selling it's differnt kinds of
  coffee. This site represents hick's law because its menus and navigation are kept
  very simple. There aren't many decisions to make to get to where you need to go
  as you can tell from the menu buttons.</p>
  
  <h2>80/20 Rule</h2>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ObGmFhL.png">
  <p>This is a screenshot of Amazon where you need to enter a new address for your orders
  to be shipped. This is representative of the 80/20 rule because the majority of the location where Amazon orders are shipped are in the United States and that country is selected by default in the country optiion box. The selection is catered to where a large percentage of where the people who purchase items ship.</p>
  
  <h2>Modularity</h2>

  <p>This is a screenshot fo a designers website with some of their work displayed on the main pain. This is an example of modualrity because each picture is combined to make up the design of the website and how the user views the content.</p>
  
  <h2>Chunking</h2>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YbrRAJ3.jpg">
  <p>This is a screenshot of the bottom of a newsite page where its navigations to different categories of news are placed. This is an example of chunking because it is a logical way to group many difffernt articles of news by location in a pleasing way.</p>
