  <p>This is a screenshot of a coffee brewing company's site. This is an example of Hick's Law because the menus are kept very clear and it is easy to navigate to where you need to go, whether that be purchasing coffee, or contacting them. There aren't many different decisions to be made on the main page.</p>
  <h2>80/20 Rule</h2>

  <p>This is a screenshot of adding a new address to the Amazon site to ship your order to. This is an example of the 80/20 rule because the majority of Amazon orders are shipped to the United States currently, so the country option for the address is defaulted to the United States. This is focused on benefitting whatever place is recieving the highest percentage of Amazon orders.</p>
  <h2>Modularity</h2>
